                This week I decided to look more into React hooks. Up until now, I haven't really taken the time to truly understand 
                how hooks function on a deeper level. It makes sense in the labs and videos, but if I had to implement them on my own without 
                direction, I would most likely struggle. All good skills take lot of practice though, and I will definitely be getting 
                that practice on the upcoming project. This blog will come in handy at that point.

                <h3>The State Hook</h3>
            </header>

            <p class="body-text">
                According to React 
                <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html" target="_none">documentation</a>
                , the state hook was introduced in v16.8 
                to allow people to use the state feature without writing an actual class.
                Previously, you would have to make a class that 'extended' React.component. 
                The class would set it's state values in the constructor, and then you would use 
                'this' to set the state when a change occured. I'm not going to go too much more 
                into React classes because we won't be using them at all, but React's new functional 
                components and state hooks are much cleaner compared to the classes.
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                Before I go into actual the functionality of state hooks, I want to clarify what a state 
                is and when you would need to use one. I found this helpful github 
                <a href="https://github.com/uberVU/react-guide/blob/master/props-vs-state.md" target="_none">documentation</a> 
                about props and state. <b>"The state starts with a default value when a Component
                mounts and then has mutations over time (mostly generated from user events). It's a 
                serializable representation of one point in time - a snapshot."</b> If at any point you 
                need to add dynamic behavior based on some action by the user, you will need a state.
                In the case of the github lab, we needed to add a state for the query input 
                that was provided by the user, because that input led to a dynamic event 
                which generated search results (represented by repository components).
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                The state hook actually creates a state and allows you to change it later.
                Here is a simple example:
                <div class="flex-code-container"><pre class="code"><code>const [count, setCount] = useState(0);</code></pre></div>
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
            The useState() function returns two values: the state variable (count), and a function to set a new
            state (setCount). The argument in useState (in this case 0) is the initial value of 
            the state. You can use the setCount function after the user has made some change,
            like pressing a button or adding some input. A state to me is basically a fancy event listener in React
            (if you apply it to some onChange event for an element).
            </p>

                <h3>The Effect Hook</h3>
            </header>

            <p class="body-text">
                We've learned up to this point that a hook is a special function 
                that lets you gain access to React features from components. The 
                effect hook is a bit different from the state hook. You would use 
                an effect hook when you want to make a "side effect" operation, 
                according to React documentation. Examples of this operation 
                include fetching some 
                data, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in 
                a component. 
                Here is a simple example: 
                <div class="flex-code-container"><pre class="code"><code>useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
);</code></pre></div>
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                In the effect hook above, React knows to call this 
                effect after the DOM has been updated. The useEffect function
                runs after every render. A nice feature of useEffect()
                is that you can return a cleanup function inside useEffect(). 
                This will run when the 
                component 'unmounts' and also after every render.
            </p>

                <h3>Tips for Using Hooks</h3>
            </header>

            <p class="body-text">
                Below are some tips for using hooks from React docs:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Only call hooks at the top level</b>: don't use hooks inside
                        loops, conditions, or nested functions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Only call hooks from React functions</b>: Don't call 
                        hooks from regular JS functions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Install ESLint!</b>: This plugin, released by React,
                        enforces both of the above tips.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                I enjoyed taking this time to gain a more in-depth view of hooks using React. I feel a lot 
                more confident in my ability to apply the use of hooks on my own, and I am excited to apply these 
                skills to the upcoming project.
