            <p>Developing accessible web pages is very important as a web developer. As our world is becoming dependent
                on the Internet
                for more of our daily tasks, we have to take into account accessibility features and make sure everyone
                can view the
                content we are serving out. I think that all web developers should be aware of accessiblity features and
                apply those
                concepts when writing code.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to this
                <a href="https://www.accessiblemetrics.com/blog/4-key-takeaways-from-2018-web-accessibility-lawsuits/"
                    target="_blank">site</a>, <b>2,250 lawsuits were filed for inadequate web accessiblity in 2018</b>.
                Suits range from large companies
                such as Netflix to small companies. I think that people should incorporate accessbility features because
                it's the right thing
                do, not because they fear a lawsuit (although if that's what it takes so be it.)
                With the help of <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/make-your-website-accessible/"
                    target="_blank">this</a>
                blog post, I am going to dicuss how to apply a few important accessibility features.
            </p>
            <header class="subheader">
                <h3>Tab Navigation</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                One important accessibility feature is tab navigation, or the ability to navigate the page
                using the physical tab button on your keyboard.
                This feature is important for people who may not be able to view the screen, but have the ability to use
                the keyboard.
                So, let's try it out. I'm going to add two different buttons below.
            </p>
            <div id="button-group">
                <button id="button-item" onclick="location.href='blog1.html'" type="button">Blog 1</button>
                <button id="button-item" onclick="location.href='index.html'" type="button">Back To Home</button>
            </div>
            <p>
                You can loop through the buttons on the screen
                using the tab button on the keyboard and go to the actual page
                by hitting the enter button on the keyboard. As important as it is to have the ability to
                tab between buttons, I think the feature of navigating between pages using those buttons is just as
                important. If you
                tab through this screen, you can see that you can tab through the buttons, but not hyperlinks. Because
                of this,
                <b>buttons are of better use to navigate between screens instead of plain hyperlinks.</b>
            </p>
            <header class="subheader">
                <h3>Color Constrast</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                The next important feature that all web pages should have is good color contrast. People view color in
                different
                ways, therefore everyone on that spectrum should have the ability to view the content on the webpage
                regardless
                of their abiity to see color in the "same way" as everyone else. Below is an example of bad color
                contrast:
            </p>
            <div id="bad-color-parent">
                <div id="bad-color-text">
                    Yikes :/
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                The text does not show up well at all, and the background color makes the text hard to see (and painful
                to look at).
                Here is an example of good color contrast:
            </p>
            <div id="good-color-parent">
                <div id="good-color-text">
                    Yay!!! :)
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                In the above example, the colors go together well and you can easily see the content within the
                container.
                The blog says that "ideally, you should set a dark color against a lighter one." Let's test the above
                color
                combinations in this <a href="https://contrastchecker.com/" target="_blank"> contrast checker</a>
                site to test that hypothesis. Uhh... yeah the first one failed all of the tests.
                The second one on the other hand passed all of the tests. This site is nice because you can switch on
                a grayscale viewer that allows you to see what the result would be for someone who is colorblind.
            </p>
            <header class="subheader">
                <h3>Header Navigation</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                The next important feature of an accessible website is having clearly labeled headers. I had to fix my
                code
                a bit to comply with these standards. It doesn't sound like a pressing issue when coding, but it is
                really
                important for people who rely on readers to go through web pages. For instance, you should not include
                two
                different h1 headers on the page as that can get confusing for people who rely on readers.
            </p>
            <p>
                On this web page,
                the big header at the top uses an h1 tag to relay it's importance as the main header. My name beneath it
                as well as the topic of this blog both use h2 tags because they're important, but not
                as important as h1. The subsequent "sub-headers" on the
                page
                all use the h3 tag because they are the next "level" in header importance. If I wanted to break up this
                section into
                two subsequent sections, I would label both of those headers using the h4 tag because that would be
                the next level of headers.
            </p>
            <header class="subheader">
                <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                I enjoyed learning about the topic of website accessibility, and I will definitely be applying it
                beyond this class. <b>Developing accessible websites is necessary and will contribute to a more
                    inclusive online world where everyone feels comfortable accessing content.</b>
