                <h3>Imagine that you are teaching CS 347 next fall. How would you design your version of the course?

                The answer to this question depends on whether the course is taught online or in person. Since this
                course
                was taught online, I will just assume we are keeping it that way. I would organize the course into
                modules. Each module would cover an 'umbrella' topic and I would post it on a publicly available website,
                much
                like the one we currently use. I find that I learn better when things are organized into
                sections
                or something similar because I can associate the topics/subtopics better in my head. It would also make
                materials
                easier to locate on the website because students could find materials by topic.

            <p class="body-text">
                Moving past organization, I would have one lecture class and one lab class every week.
                Each lab would be an application of what we covered in class on the previous lecture day.
                Online lectures can get boring, so I would probably keep it straightforward and go over basic
                concepts that are necessary for the topic (ex: when learning flex box, do one or two simple examples to
                explain
                the general concept).
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                I would have each individual
                student submit a lab by Friday, though they would be able to work together on the lab day. I would also
                post additional "special-topic" video lectures that go over more advanced topics. I like how the exams account
                for a smaller percentage of our grade in this class, not because exams are stressful, but because web development
                is something you have to practice regularly in order to become better (in my experience). For this reason
                I would keep the grade for exams pretty low, similar to
                this class. 
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                Students would also do an application-based project, but I would split it up 
                into two parts. It would be two separate project grades, but they would build on their previous project. 
                In previous classes that were more project-based, I appreciated when we were able to make several increments
                of one project that came together at the end. I felt more confident in my ability to describe/present the project 
                and I got more out of it when I could add on to previous increments. You can essentially track your progress over 
                time and I liked that.

                Something I have learned about online classes is that I get uhhh...lazy. I basically won't do an assignment unless 
                there is an incentive to do it. If we had in-person classes and the professor said to do something, everyone would do it
                regardless of the grade because no one really has a choice. But we've lost that through online learning.
                The videos were really helpful, 
                but I found that I wasn't fully attentive when watching them. During the labs, if no one in the group knew how 
                to do something, we would go back and reference the videos - which is fine, and I did learn by doing that. 
                But during the occasions where I didn't share 
                my screen and have the code on my machine, I didn't comprehend what we did as much as I would have liked to.

                <b>The times when I felt personally obligated to learn stuff was when I learned the most.</b> Often times this was when 
                I had the responsibility of sharing my screen during the lab, or had to learn it to work on the project. 
                This is why I would have an individually-graded lab due every week. I probably wouldn't grade it 
                for accuracy, but just to hold people accountable to learn and keep up with stuff. 
                I think it would benefit both parties. <b>I comprehended the material the most when working on the projects, in-class labs 
                (when I was sharing/submitting), and watching the videos in order to complete a graded task. </b>
