                This week I explored modal boxes. I didn't realize how often modal boxes are used today, but
                I see them quite frequently as login/sign up boxes when visiting a website. Modal boxes extend to cases
                beyond that
                as well because they highlight important information that the viewer needs to see right away. According
                to
                this <a
                    href=https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/modal-and-modeless-boxes-in-web-design--webdesign-2282
                    target="_blank">
                    blog</a>, there are five use cases that modal boxes are commonly used for:
            <ul class="modal-case-list">
                <li><b>Alert</b> the user that an error has occured</li>
                <li><b>Warn</b> the user of something</li>
                <li><b>Collect</b> data from users</li>
                <li><b>Remind</b> user of something before moving on</li>
                <li><b>Inform</b> users of important information</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Basic Modal</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                Following this
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp" target="_blank">W3 tutorial</a>,
                I am going to display a basic modal box below:
                <!-- begin demo code from w3schools -->
                    <!-- Trigger/Open The Modal -->
                    <button id="myBtn">Open Modal</button>

                    <!-- The Modal -->
                <div id="myModal" class="modal">

                    <!-- Modal content -->
                    <div class="modal-content">
                        <span class="close">&times;</span>
                        <p>Woooooo modal text</p>
                    </div>

                </div>
            </p>

            <p class="p1-txt-blog4">There's quite a lot happening in the background to display this modal box.
                The button that opens the modal triggers the modal box to display on the screen.
                The modal is styled in CSS, but it's display property is set to none so that it
                doesn't display until the button is clicked. Once the button is clicked,
                the script grabs the modal element and sets it's display to block.
                I thought I would have to do something
                fancy to make the background fade out, but the background color of the element is just set
                to black with a greater opacity level.
            </p>

            <p class="p1-txt-blog4">
                One new property tag that I hadn't seen before today was the z-index tag. This is set to 1 for
                the modal element. This tag essentially moves the element to be at the top of the display stack.
                It only works with positioned elements, and because the modal element has a fixed position,
                the element appears to be "on top of" the other elements.
            </p>

            <p class="p1-txt-blog4">
                I also learned something new about JavaScript by making this modal box. Instead of including the
                function inside of the button element using the onclick function, the demo calls onclick in the
                script directly:</p>
            <pre id="demo-code-blog4">
                <code>
                    btn.onclick = function() {
                        modal.style.display = "block";
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p class="p1-txt-blog4">I personally think this is cleaner and more concise because the HTML code has
                content,
                JavaScript code has functionality, and CSS has styling. Each component only has code
                pertaining to it's sole function.</p>

                Creating a modal box was very fun and I enjoyed learning about them. They have many uses and it was a
                lot
                easier to implement then I had expected.
