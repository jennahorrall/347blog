            <p>This week I decided it was best to look into JavaScript techniques as we will be learning more about it soon.
                I came across this cool video containing some 'hacks' you can do when printing to the console in JavaScript.
            </p>

            <p> If you are debugging some code and want to quickly see the value of a variable, these suggestions
                make it easier to view those things when printing to the console.

                <h3>Time Log</h3>
            </header>

            <p> Time log is very helpful when you are trying to measure performance of a function or a portion of code. If you want
                to time how long something takes to run, you can initialize a timer using: 
                
                <pre class="sample-code">console.time('description');</pre> 
                To print the time at a certain part within your code: 
                <pre class="sample-code">console.timeLog('description');</pre>
                To end the timer and print the final result:
                <pre class="sample-code">console.timeEnd('description');</pre>
                This funcionality comes in handy when you quickly want to measure the performance of a function.
            </p>

            <header class="subheader">
                <h3>Table Log</h3>
            </header>

            <p>The next console hack is printing an array to the console in the form of a table. If you have an array
                that has consistent data attributes, you can print it to the console as a table:
                <pre class="sample-code">console.table(array);</pre>
                For instance, if you have an array named 'color' with two elements: each containing 'name' and 'favorite color,' you can print
                that array to the console:
                <pre class="sample-code">console.table(color);</pre>
                 The result will be a nicely formatted table. 
            </p>

                I enjoyed learning about the topic of website accessibility, and I will definitely be applying it
                beyond this class. <b>Developing accessible websites is necessary and will contribute to a more
                    inclusive online world where everyone feels comfortable accessing content.</b>
