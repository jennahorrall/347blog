            <p>This week I decided it was best to look into JavaScript techniques as we will be learning more about it
                soon.
                I came across this cool video below containing some 'hacks' you can do when printing to the console in
                JavaScript.
                These will definitely be helpful when we start learning about JavaScript and do testing/debugging.</p>
            <p>Prior to watching this video, I wanted to make sure I was clear on the many different ways to print
                something
                in JavaScript. Following this
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_output.asp" target="_blank">w3schools documentation</a>, I
                learned that there are actually four different ways
                to print something in JavaScript:</p>
            <ul id="print-method-list">
                <li class="print-method-item"><b>innerHTML</b>: This method prints html elements using JavaScript. To
                    use this,
                    simply create a script that references the element and call ".innerHTML" on that element. This
                    method
                    is more helpful if you need to know the value of an html element dynamically.
                </li>
                <li class="print-method-item"><b>document.write()</b>: This is similar to innerHTML, but if it's used
                    after the html page is loaded
                    then it will overwrite all of the HTML. It's recommended that this method should only be used for
                    testing.
                </li>
                <li class="print-method-item"><b>window.alert()</b>: You can place window.alert() in a script and pass
                    whatever
                    you want to print as an argument. I think the drawback of this method is that it comes
                    up as an alert box, so it might get annoying unless you want to see it immediately.
                </li>
                <li class="print-method-item"><b>console.log()</b>: The final method that is also referenced in the
                    video
                    is console.log(). This will display in the browser and is mainly used for debugging purposes.
                    In order to see it, you have to open up your browsers developer tools and go to the console to see
                    it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This video below talks about two "hacks" when printing to the console.

            <header class="subheader">
                <h3>Time Log</h3>
            </header>
            <p> Time log comes in handy when you are trying to measure performance of a function or a portion of code.
                If you want
                to time how long something takes to run, you can initialize a timer using:
            <pre class="sample-code">console.time('description');</pre>
            To print the time at a certain part within your code:
            <pre class="sample-code">console.timeLog('description');</pre>
            To end the timer and print the final result:
            <pre class="sample-code">console.timeEnd('description');</pre>
            </p>
            <header class="subheader">
                <h3>Table Log</h3>
            </header>
            <p>The next console hack is printing an array to the console in the form of a table. If you have an array
                that has consistent data attributes, you can print it to the console as a table:
            <pre class="sample-code">console.table(array);</pre>
            For instance, if you have an array named 'color' with two elements: each containing 'name' and 'favorite
            color,' you can print
            that array to the console:
            <pre class="sample-code">console.table(color);</pre>
            The result will be a nicely formatted table that displays in the console.
            </p>

                <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                I enjoyed learning about this topic and it's interesting to me that there are so many ways to print
                one value using JavaScript. It increases the flexibility of the language.
