                This week, I'll be looking more into React. I want to learn more about it before
                I start working on the next project, so I decided to go with a video this week that has pro tips from
                React developers with code samples:
            </p>

                After looking through the comments, I noticed that some people were saying these were beginner tips
                and not pro tips,
                but either way they will be helpful to a beginner like myself. Below are the 6 tips that the channel
                "Vue Mastery" says are important when working with React:
            </p>

            <ol class="body-text">

                <li><b>Use functional components</b>: This means you should use a function-based
                    component rather than a class-based component. A functional component accepts props as an
                    argument and returns a React element. Here is an example of a functional component from the
                    video:
                    <pre>
                    <code>
                      function Welcome(props) {
                          return &lt;h1&gt; Hi, {props.name}!&lt;/h1 &gt;
                      }
                    </code>
                </pre>

                    This looks pretty different compared to a class-based element:
                    <pre>
                    <code>
                      class Welcome extends Component {
                          render() {
                            return &lt;h1&gt; Hi, {this.props.name}!&lt;/h1 &gt;
                          }
                      }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                    We saw the function-based component in our lab and video exercises for React.
                </li>

                <li><b>Keep your components small:</b> There are many benefits to keeping your components
                    on the smaller end. They are easier to test, read, maintain, and reuse.
                </li>

                <li><b>Understand how to handle 'this':</b> In a class-based component, you have to handle
                    'this' by binding it to the functions inside that component. The video recommends
                    binding the functions in two ways: binding it in the render function and in the constructor.
                    Binding it in the constructor will have better performance.
                </li>

                <li><b>Use a function for setState, not an object:</b> Because React does not absolutely
                    guarantee that the state change will be applied immediately after the change, it
                    is more safe to use an object for setState rather than reference this.state.
                </li>

                <li><b>Utilize prop-types:</b> Prop-types is a library that validates the type of props.
                    It is an external library that you have to install, but it will help prevent bugs.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Use React developer tools:</b> In the console, there is a tab for "React" that
                    allows you to view React components along with their props, state, and context.
                    This will definitely come in handy when debugging.
                </li>
            </ol>

                I learned a lot in this video that will definitely be helpful going forward. I learned some new
                things and was able to relate others back to the labs and exercises we have already done.
