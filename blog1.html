            about cool things you can do with CSS, I came across this really cool typewriter effect. You usually only see this typewriter effect
            when you are the user typing something yourself, so I thought it was cool that this effect can be displayed to the user when on a webpage.
            I do wish that this effect would loop instead of just typing the word out and stopping at that point. Here is the effect:</p>
            <div id="background"> 
                <div class="typewriter">
                    <p>hellooooo!!!</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p id="p2"> The code I gathered from this <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/typewriter-effect/"target="_blank">demo</a>
                was pretty straightforward. I really like that website because it has a bunch of tutorials and videos for
                really specific HTML/CSS features and beginner videos, I will probably reference that site again! Anyways, back to the
                code. The bulk of the code was CSS animation. Here is the main CSS code from the above demo:</p>
            <div>
                <pre class="css-code-snippet">
                    #background {
                        background: #333;
                        padding-top: 2em;
                        padding-bottom: 2em;
                        width: 400px;
                        display: flex;
                        justify-content: center;
                        margin: auto;
                      }
                      
                      /* DEMO-SPECIFIC STYLES */
                      .typewriter {
                        color: #fff;
                        font-family: monospace;
                        overflow: hidden; /* Ensures the content is not revealed until the animation */
                        border-right: .15em solid orange; /* The typwriter cursor */
                        white-space: nowrap; /* Keeps the content on a single line */
                        margin: 0 auto; /* Gives that scrolling effect as the typing happens */
                        letter-spacing: .15em; /* Adjust as needed */
                        animation: 
                          typing 3.5s steps(30, end),
                          blink-caret .5s step-end infinite;
                      }
                      
                      /* The typing effect */
                      @keyframes typing {
                        from { width: 0 }
                        to { width: 100% }
                      }
                      
                      /* The typewriter cursor effect */
                      @keyframes blink-caret {
                        from, to { border-color: transparent }
                        50% { border-color: orange }
                      }
                </pre>
            </div>
            <p id="p3">
                The first background selector is aimed at the black background portion. It adds some padding, sets the width, margins,
                and centers the element. The second selector is aimed at the typewriter class which is located within the background 
                div element in the HTML code.
                
                I did some further research on the animation and overflow tags because these were both new to me and the demo did not
                go into detail about them. According to this 
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_overflow.asp"target="_blank">doc</a> on w3schools,
                <b>the overflow property "specifies what should happen if content overflows an element's box."</b> This propoerty ensures that the
                text does not show until the cursor moves past it. 
            </p>

                The animation tag was definitely new to me so I was excited to explore
                this one. After looking through this <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation.asp"target="_blank">doc</a>
                about CSS animations, I learned that there are actually two different animations under the 'main' animation property in this demo. 
                <b>The final animation in the typewriter effect is a combination of both the typing and blink-caret effect. </b>
                The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation-keyframes.asp"target="_blank">keyframes</a>
                sections are actually rules, not selectors which I have been used to. Keyframes specify the code of the animation,
                or where on the screen the animation moves and at what point. For example, the 'typing' animation moves from
                width 0 (of the element with the class typewriter) to width 100%, meaning the end of the element.

                I really enjoyed learning about this cool feature, mostly because I haven't learned about CSS animations yet. For some reason
                I always associated animations with JavaScript, I'm not sure why. I would like to acknowledge 
                this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0ob5OTpNI4&feature=youtu.be"target="_blank">lecture video</a>
                as I learned how to set up the monocolumn UI layout that I will be using for this blog.
