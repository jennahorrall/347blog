                This week I explored the future of Web Development. I'm interested in how the field
                will change in the next few years and what new technologies or methods will be on the rise.
                The stage of web development has changed rapidly over the past 20 years, and it's exciting to think
                about where it will be in the next 20.
            </p>
            <p class="blog5-main">
                A resource I looked at was this 
                <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-future-of-web-development/" target="_blank">blog</a> 
                from GeeksforGeeks. The blog identifies six different
                technologies or trends that will soon take over the development forefront.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="blog5-item">
                    <b>Artificial intelligence</b>: Artificial intelligence is currently being used by major
                    companies, and soon this technology will be more widely available for sites to implement.
                </li>
                <li class="blog5-item">
                    <b>Internet of Things</b>: I was a bit confused why this topic was brought up, but after reading
                    into it further it made more sense. The internet of things refers to the millions of devices
                    connected to the internet. These devices all collect and send data over the network and does
                    not require human interaction. This is related to web development because soon web develpers
                    will need to provide applciations that display and interpret data collected from these devices.

                    One connection I thought of that relates to this point is new popular devices such as Fitbits
                    and other fitness tracking mechanisms. The devices are great, but they are practically useless
                    without the ability to display meaningful information to the user through an interface. This
                    is what I thought of when reading it, and I think the rise of new devices will require
                    web developers to gain a more complex understanding of the physical structure of the devices,
                    how to collect and make sense of the data, and creating a user interfaces that support the data.

                <li class="blog5-item">
                    <b>Virtual Reality</b>: Virtual Reality has definitely been on the rise in recent years.
                    New headsets available to the public accompanied by VR applications has contributed to this
                    boom. Some companies have already taken advantage of VR capability by doing virtual tours of
                    apartments
                    and even simulating products from a business in the real world (though that's AR). VR capability
                    in web applications will definitely increase more within the next few years.

                <li class="blog5-item">
                    <b>360 degree video</b>: Another aspect that will be included in websites is 360 video.
                    It provides users with a more interactive view and will probably get more attention than
                    regular photos/videos. In my VR/AR class, we used 360 video cameras to shoot a movie...
                    it was pretty hard. You have to position the camera very carefully to truly put something
                    at the center of the shot because you can see so much at once. It will be interesting to see
                    which content will be captured using 360 cameras.

                <li class="blog5-item">
                    <b>Voice Command:</b> The blog predicts that voice command technology will continue to
                    expand in the development of web applications.
                </li>
                <li class="blog5-item">
                    <b>Motion User Interface</b>: The last trend or technology that this blog
                    predicts will rise is motion design. I've seen recently that business are starting
                    to implement this technology, and it's definitely more attractive to customers.
